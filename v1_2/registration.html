					<p class="introstatement">To use BookEX, you have to agree to the follwing terms.</p>
					<p>This document assumes that you have an English install of Notepad++. If you have installed it in another language, the commands and options will probably have been translated into your native language. In that case, find the command with the similar name, the logical grouping will still be the same. All the images used in this helpfile assume the default settings. If you change any of these settings, you'll have to look for the other image instead, this is most noticable with the toolbar (the position of images will always remain the same).</p>
					<p class="agreementconditions">
					You agree that:<br/>
						<ul>
							<li>You will return the book you borrow on time and in as good condition as when borrowed.</li>
							<li>You agree to pay for the damage or loss of the book that you borrow.</li>
							<li>You will not hack the system.</li>
							<li>Will not spam other members with your request.</li>
						</ul>						
						You will have to use your UW NetID to log in.
